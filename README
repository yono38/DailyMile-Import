Ever run with a friend, and they uploaded to dailymile but you forgot to?

Well now you can keep up on dailymile too by importing their entries to your account.

TODO:
Cleanup code
Add interface to search for users

Until I do that:
Logging in brings you to '/me', to get to the import page do '/entries/[their username]' and then check the boxes you want and click import
